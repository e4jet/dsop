## Who?

### Who is this for?

Anyone who is interested in learning about taking advantage of storage in the container ecosystem. A basic understanding of containers is recommended, but thats all. The first episode will provide an overview of container orchestration systems like Kubernetes, Swarm, and Marathon. We'll dive deeper as we go along.

### Who is providing this?

My name is [Eric Forgette](https://sites.google.com/site/eric4jet/) and I'm a Distinguished Technologist at [HPE](https://www.hpe.com/). My GitHub username is [e4jet](https://github.com/e4jet/). Although I'm not particularly active, my Twitter username is [eric4jet](https://twitter.com/eric4jet).

Please note that this is my personal repository and screencast series. The opinions expressed here may not reflect those of my employer.

## What?

A series of screencasts on leveraging storage in the container ecosystem. The recordings have a fairly low production quality because they will be recorded in one take and only lightly edited. You'll have to excuse the number of times I say ummm.


What does __Durable State of Persistence__ mean? Nothing really. I simply chose some related buzzwords and arranged them into a somewhat meaningful phrase.

Much of the inspiration for this series (especially the demo format) comes from [Francesc Campoy](https://twitter.com/francesc)'s awesome series on Go called [just for func](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NTKMKDsCTE). If you have any interest in the [Go language](https://golang.org/) you should check out his channel.

## Why?

The industry has seen a significant shift toward containers and container orchestration systems. We are at a point where users want to apply the advantages these technologies provide to workloads that __require state__. While I love talking live with customer, prospects, and members of the community, that format doesn't scale.

My original intent was to create a series for internal use at HPE, but when I considered how much I've learned from the community, it was a 'no-brainer' to use this opportunity to give back.

>Over time as StatefulSets, and custom controllers for managing them, mature, Kubernetes will be a great solution for running any workload.

## Where?

## When?

Initially, as often as possible. Later it will depend on the usefulness of this series (measured by feedback and popularity).

## How?

The format will be quite informal. It is meant to feel like the viewer and I are having a chat about the topic at hand. Of course I'm quite talkative, so the discussions are slightly one sided. If you feel like nodding once in awhile, great!

I'll leverage simple diagrams to explain concepts and then demonstrate functionality on a live system. Most videos will range from 5 to 15 minutes.
